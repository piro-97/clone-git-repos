## Usage

add to ```repo_urls.txt``` the urls of the repositories you would like to clone

run ```main.py [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR]``` to clone all the repositories to OUTPUT_DIR

notice that you must have the permission to access the repos and you need to be logged to github through ssh on your local machine
