## Usage

add to ```repos.txt``` the names of the repositories you would like to clone (space or newline separation is fine)

run ```main.py github-username [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR]``` to clone all the repositories to OUTPUT_DIR

notice that you must have the permission to access the repos and you need to be logged to github thorough ssh on your local machine
